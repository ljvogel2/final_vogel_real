					<h3>History of Chicago Race Issues</h3>
					<p>Chicago has always been a city divided. Even with the reputation of famous black Chicagoans like Ida B. Wells, Rude Foster, and Kanye West, Chicago has still remained deeply segregated and divided. You don't even need to look at big statistics, just go down to the streets of Chicago, and you'll see that while one street might be primarily black, half-a-mile North might be a completely different racial majority.</p>
					<p>History tells the same story. In 1919 a young boy was killed by being stoned and drowned. His crime? Accidently swimming to the "white side" of the water. He was only 14 years old. This lead to one of the bloodiest riots in postwar America. In these riots, over 35 people died during the riots, more than 500 were left injured, and 1,000 black homeowners lost their homes when they were torched by rioters. </p>
					<p>The reality is, Chicago has a deep racial problem in the city. From redlining and segregation, to modern day slavery in the justice system in America. Look no further than the constant police harassment as well as police misconduct charges in Chicago, and the Laquan McDonald case. According to Mia Henry, a Chicago based activist as well as University of Pennsylvania graduate, "There have been local, state, and federal policies to isolate and deny resources to black neighborhoods across the country. Chicago [is] no exception."</p>

					<h3>White Flight and the Affect on Chicago</h3>
					<p>Even with the incredibly large racial issues in Chicago since its inception, White people are still leaving at an increasingly higher rate than Black people. According to a report by the Department of planning, since 1980, Chicago`s Black population has risen, while the White population has shrunk to the point where the two are nearly the same size. </p>
					<p>If you look at the chart on the left, you can see how the White population has tanked in size since the 1980 U.S Census, where it shows a drop from over five million, to just under one million. Meanwhile, the Black population of Chicago has also steadily decreased, as the closing of factory jobs and movement of Americans westward is non-racial, however the percentage drops have not been nearly as big as the White population.</p>
					<p>This can be attributed to the money required to move out, as well as the community aspects of Chicagoans. In terms of money, according to an Urban.org study, on average White households have ten times the wealth of a Black family, and eight times the wealth of a Hispanic family. It can be easier for White residents in Chicago to move to California or Texas where it's cheaper to live and there are more job opportunities, while on average Black and Hispanic families aren't afforded such a risk.</p>

					<h3>Racial Divide and a Changing Racial Landscape</h3>
					<p>Another thing that has changed since the 1980s is how populations identify themselves, and how that's affecting Chicago Census data as well. The 2020 U.S Census data shown above shows how over the last ten years, while the White and Black populations continue to fall, every other group in Chicago are growing in size, from Hispanic and Asian, all the way to an increase in Native Hawaiin and Pacific Islanders. Groups that would previously have no other choice than to group themselves as "other" or group themselves with White or Black now have a checkbox with their race on it, which is leading to increases in population, despite dwindling Chicago population numbers as a whole.</p>
					<p>It's also important to mention that while the White and Black populations of Chicago continue to fall, that doesn't mean it's at the same rate. White decrease is at a higher percentage than Black decrease in the last ten years, again coining back to the "White flight" that has affected countless midwestern cities, not just Chicago.</p>
					<p>On the chart to the left, you can see the breakdown of different races in Chicago as well. It's already easy to tell how segregated Chicago is, just look at the map! Each neighborhood divided by race, with entire parts of the city being a singular race as a whole. If you were describing Chicago to someone, it would be as easy as saying, North is white, south is Black, west is White Black and Hispanic.</p>
					<p>So while Chicago might be a historic Black city, it is by no means a historically fair city to those Black residents. Again, the idea that each group would just magically live next to eachother and have no overlap is absurd, as these precise lines are a component of constant redlining and segregation policies that make it incredibly difficult for POC to buy and sell land in White areas. Another large problem that's causing this is gang violence, which can cause different racial groups to flock to specific neighborhoods with people of the same race for their own safety.</p>
					<p>At the end of the day, Chicago will always be a deeply racially divided city. Census data can show us that Chicago is moving to be more equally Black and White due to "White flight" and other contributing factors, but racist and discriminatory practices will always keep race groups seperated, and in constant conflict with eachtother.</p>
